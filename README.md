Calculate Array
This is a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers and calculates the minimum and maximum values as well as the number of odd numbers in the array.

Usage
To use the function, simply pass an array of integers as an argument to the calculateArray function. The function will then log the minimum and maximum values as well as the number of odd numbers to the console.

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
calculateArray(arr);

This will output the following to the console:
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 9
Number of odd numbers: 5
